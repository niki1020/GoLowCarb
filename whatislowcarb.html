            <p><strong>A low-carb diet means that you eat fewer carbohydrates and a higher proportion of fat. This can also be called a low-carb, high-fat diet (LCHF) or a keto diet.</strong></p>

            <p>For decades we've been told that fat is detrimental to our health. 
            Meanwhile, low-fat "diet" products, often full of sugar, have flooded supermarket shelves. 
            This has likely been a major mistake, that coincided with the start of the obesity epidemic. 
            While this doesn't prove causation, it's clear the low-fat message didn't prevent the obesity increase, and it is possible it contributed.<br>
                
            Studies now show that there's no reason to fear natural fats. Instead, on a low-carb diet fat is your friend!</p>
               

            <p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>
            
            <p>
                <ul>
                    
                    <li style="list-style: none;">Eat​: Meat, fish, eggs, vegetables growing above ground and natural fats (like butter).</li>
                    <li style="list-style: none;">Avoid:​ Sugar and starchy foods (like bread, pasta, rice, beans and potatoes).</li>
                    <li style="list-style: none;">Eat when you're hungry and stop when you're satisfied. It can be that simple. </li>
                    <li style="list-style: none;">You do not need to count calories or weigh your food. </li>
                    <li style="list-style: none;">You don't need low-fat products.</li>
                    

                </ul>

        </p>

            <b>Who should not do a strict low-carb diet?</b> <br>
            <br>
            
            Most people can safely start a low-carb diet. But in these three situations you may need some preparation or adaptation:<br>
            <br>
            
            Are you taking medication for diabetes, e.g. insulin?<br>
            Are you taking medication for high blood pressure?<br>
            Are you currently breastfeeding?<br>
            If you're not in any of these groups, you should be good to go!<br>
