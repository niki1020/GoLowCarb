        <p>I am Niki who is just any fitness freak you see working out in the gym, jogging on the streets, 
        doing grocery at health stores and always curious to know more about how to get better mentally and physically in life.</p>

        <p>The reason I started this blog is solely for my interest in health and fitness. 
        
        I love to help people with their fitness journey. 
        
        I like to talk, read and breath healthy lifestyle and love to surround myself with like-minded folks. 
        
        I love reading health-related books, learn from fitness gurus, attend seminars- just keep myself updated with health news/ diets/ products and so on.</p>

        <p>In the last few years, I came across low carb diet and also researched a lot on how it has cured many diseases and helped several people. 
        
        I won't say this diet will be perfect for you but if you want to give it a shot and if you see great results in your overall health, I'd suggest making it your lifestyle!</p>

        <p>I have been a health freak all my life and will continue to be the same forever. 
        
        I am not perfect or have always been this way and yes I do indulge in crappy food choices here and there but I also try to get back on track as soon as I can.</p>

          <p><b><i>So you can too!!!</i></b></p>

        <p>I don't work out every day or hit the gym for hours, my only goal is to simply stay active. So whichever way you think you can be active through the day just do that.</p>

        <p><b>Just listen to your body!</b></p>

        <p>I feel great that I decided to start this food blog so you can be a part of my health journey as well. 
        I am glad I am able to share all low carb recipes that I have tried and would love if you want to give it a try as well. 
        Don't forget to let me know if you liked it!</p>
        
       

        <p>Thank you so much for reading!</p>
